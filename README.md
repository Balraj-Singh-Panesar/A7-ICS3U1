        Ideas

        Two players

        2D graphics

        Best out of 3

        Different colors (possibly shapes too)

        Something happens when you win or lose

        Ask for user's name 

        As game goes on the levels get more difficult (make blockages, expand the screen)

        Falling animation (possibly a bounce effect as well)

        Needs

        Menu (enter your name, press play)

        Game screen has a 7/7 grid ( maybe larger)

        Play clicks in the slot they want to put their block in

        Checks if player places block in a slot already full (will say “cannot place there” or something)

        Will check to see if the board is a tie (a screen will pop up saying its a tie)

        Winner screen (play again button at the bottom)

        Cuts back to the menu

        Wants

        Block bounces

        Custom colors/shapes

        Block falls into slot

        Accomplishments

        The needs and wants of the project were determined, and we plan on coming up with the layout and starting the coding of the menu page tomorrow.

        Basic features include:

        Menu/starter page that has title, textboxes for users to enter player names, and the start button

        Game page which will have a 7/7 (or larger) grid, and text at the top of the page indicating with players turn it is.

        The blocks will appear in the slot by the player clicking on it (this feature may be advanced further to instead have the block fall into the slot and bounce into place)

        Text will appear if a player tries to choose a slot already taken

        A winner screen will pop up with the player who won as well as a play again button at the bottom which will take users back to the menu/starter page



        Next session

        Goal: to design the layouts of these screens (
